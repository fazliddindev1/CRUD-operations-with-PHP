## Project Explanation

This project is a **basic PHP CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system** designed to manage student records. The main purpose of this project is to practice **core PHP programming**, **form handling**, and **database operations using MySQL**.

The system allows users to **add new students** through a form, **view all existing records** in a table, **edit student information**, and **delete students** when they are no longer needed. Each operation is implemented using PHP scripts that communicate with a MySQL database.

The project uses **procedural PHP** and works with **superglobal variables** such as `$_POST` and `$_GET` to send and receive form data. SQL queries like `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` are used to perform database operations.

This project helped me understand:

* How CRUD systems work in real web applications
* How PHP interacts with MySQL databases
* How to build dynamic forms
* How to structure backend logic
* How to handle user input and database connections

Overall, this project represents my **first complete backend web application using PHP**, and it gave me a strong foundation for moving forward to **advanced PHP concepts and Laravel framework**.
