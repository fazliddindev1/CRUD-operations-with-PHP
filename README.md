## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a **Student Management CRUD System** built using **core PHP and MySQL**. It provides a simple and effective way to **manage student records** by performing all fundamental database operations: **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)**.

The main goal of this project was to **strengthen my backend development skills**, understand how real-world web applications handle data, and gain hands-on experience with **server-side logic, database integration, and form handling**.

## 🧠 How It Works

The application allows users to:

* ➕ **Add new students** through a dynamic form
* 📋 **View all student records** in a structured table
* ✏ **Edit student details** instantly
* 🗑 **Delete student entries** safely

All user interactions are processed using **PHP scripts**, which communicate directly with a **MySQL database**. Data is transferred using **HTTP methods (`GET` and `POST`)**, and all database actions are executed through **SQL queries** such as `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
